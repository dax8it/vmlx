## Current release boundary

Do not tag, notarize, or publish a new vMLX / mlxstudio release from this workstream until the live rows below are green. Static contracts, load-only proofs, and single-turn smoke rows are not sufficient.

Current package/proof state, refreshed 2026-06-06:

- Bundled Python was rebuilt from current source and `npm run verify-bundled` passed.
- Staged Sequoia app was rebuilt and Developer ID signed.
- `build/current-packaged-integrity-contract-after-unsupported-media-staged-app-20260606.json` is `status=pass`.
- `build/current-objective-proof-after-cross-family-smoke-refresh-20260606.json` closes the two Gemma4 26B CRACK rows for installed-app Responses visible-content/language and mixed-SWA speed.
- `build/current-regression-suite-after-cross-family-smoke-refresh-20260606.json` is `status=open` with `failed_steps=["release_regression_manifest"]`; source/package/parity/contracts pass, and five live/model rows remain.
- No release tag, notarized DMG, public download update, or installed-app replacement has been produced from this continuation.

The app can currently serve several text and some VLM paths, but full VL/audio/video support is not release-cleared across all model families. The remaining work must be classified as either:

- `runtime`: engine, processor, cache, scheduler, parser, UI/settings, or packaged-runtime bug.
- `model artifact`: uploaded metadata/sidecars/templates/weights are corrupt or inconsistent.
- `model behavior`: model emits wrong/malformed content even though runtime route is correct.

Do not hide a failure by forcing text-only, disabling cache, disabling MTP, changing parser rails, or fabricating tool calls. If a capability is not implemented, expose it honestly and keep the implementation row open.

## Required media runtime functions

Every advertised media-capable family must have these functions working through the live server path:

1. Artifact capability read

- Reads `config.json`, `generation_config.json`, `preprocessor_config.json`, tokenizer files, chat template, `jang_config.json`, audio tokenizer sidecars, MTP sidecars, and quant metadata.
- Separates advertised capability from runtime-proven capability.
- Rejects or marks unsupported metadata/runtime mismatches before generation.

2. Media request normalization

- Accepts OpenAI image/audio/video content parts.
- Accepts data URLs, local files through app tool paths, and remote URLs only where policy allows.
- Converts media to the family processor's expected tensors without losing prompt text or special media tokens.
- Keeps text-only requests on the text path.

3. Processor and embedding bridge

- Processor expands image/video/audio prompts into the exact family token layout.
- Model wrapper accepts `pixel_values`, video frames, audio features, `inputs_embeds`, media masks, rope/position metadata, and family-specific kwargs.
- Text model returns logits objects compatible with `mlx_lm` / vMLX generation.

4. Cache integration

- Prefix cache keys are salted by media digest and media token layout.
- Paged cache, L2 disk cache, native family cache, and TurboQuant KV do not reuse stale text/media states across different media.
- Text-only turn after rejected or successful media recovers cleanly.
- Path-dependent families reject unsafe partial restores instead of corrupting decode.

5. Scheduler / batching

- Continuous batching works where safe.
- Families that require one-shot media prefill either chunk safely or reject as typed 413 without killing the process.
- Max output tokens and max context limits are honored for media-expanded prompts.
- Streaming and non-streaming produce equivalent visible content.

6. Tool / JSON / XML discipline

- Tool-capable models emit real OpenAI `tool_calls` through the parser for API tool use.
- Raw XML-ish tool text must not be silently accepted as a parsed tool call.
- Structured-output benchmarks must use parse, repair, schema validation, and retry-on-invalid rows, while still reporting raw parse failure.
- JSON/XML repair belongs in caller-side benchmark/catalog tooling unless vMLX exposes a proven constrained decoding mode.

7. UI and packaged app parity

- Settings panel must expose only proven cache and media controls for the selected family.
- CLI preview, spawned server args, `/health`, `/v1/cache/stats`, and `/v1/models/{id}/capabilities` must agree.
- Installed `/Applications/vMLX.app` proof is required separately from source-server proof.

## Model-family rows

| Family / bundle | Current state | Open blockers | Required proof |
|---|---|---|---|
| Gemma4 12B JANG_4M | Source and installed text/image/video smoke and speed rows have passed; image prefill rejection recovers cleanly. | Full audio/video depth, larger media prompts, multi-turn media+tools, UI settings parity across all cache modes. | Live source and installed rows: image, video, audio, text-after-media, media-after-error, tools after media, streaming and non-streaming. |
| Gemma4 26B CRACK | Source-server smoke passed on 2026-06-06 for exact text, cache hit, multi-turn recall, reasoning, tool call, image/video color, and text-after-media. Installed-app Responses visible-content and mixed-SWA speed rows now pass in the refreshed objective digest. | Broader packaged media/tool parity remains open. | Installed full-output tails, installed speed gate, and packaged media/tool parity rows. |
| Qwen3.6 35B MXFP8 MTP | Current source and local installed 1.5.56 do not reproduce `gdn_sink` crash; 35B live MTP proof exists. | If user sees traceback on older app, classify stale packaged runtime; if on fresh app, find bypassing route. Need broader VL/video/tool rows. | Installed packaged Qwen35 MTP with chat/responses/streaming, image/video if advertised, MTP active, no `gdn_sink` crash. |
| Qwen3.6 27B JANG_4M MTP | Native MTP speed/equivalence rows pass under deterministic policy. | Broader media/tool/multi-turn matrix and packaged UI parity remain open. | Live source and installed app across cache modes, MTP on/off A/B, image/video if advertised. |
| LFM2.5 | Text/cache/tool UI rows have passed for known bundles. | VL/audio/video only if artifact advertises it; hybrid SSM path-dependent cache rows must stay architecture-aware. | Live media row for any VL-advertised LFM artifact, otherwise capability must remain text-only. |
| Step3.7 Flash JANG_2L | Text-only route is stable; VLM route remains unsupported unless implemented. | Do not advertise Step3.7 VLM in vMLX until real processor/model forward path passes. Tool dialect and loop discipline remain model-behavior blockers. | Text-only live rows plus explicit unsupported-VLM guard row, or real Step3.7 VLM implementation with image/video proof. |
| MiMo V2.5 JANG_2L | Fresh Max2 bundle copied locally and manifest verified; cache head crash fixed; optimized rerun shows paged/L2/TurboQuant telemetry. Conservative no-cache/no-TQ diagnostic can answer exact `ACK`. | Release-red: optimized exact-cache row can be empty or rambling; required tool calls fail both optimized and conservative modes; speed is around 1-2 tok/s or worse; no release-cleared VL/audio/video path. | Implement/fix tool protocol and decode quality, prove speed target, then implement processor/model bridge for image/video/audio and prove media rows. |
| Nemotron Omni | Prior rows exist but not current release-cleared. | Audio/image/video carryover and no-media prompt contamination need current-source and installed reproof. | Omni live matrix with text-only before/after media, audio/image/video, no hidden media carryover. |
| ZAYA / ZAYA1-VL | Typed CCA/path-dependent cache constraints are special. | VL rows must prove media cache salting and no unsafe partial CCA restore. | Live ZAYA-VL image/video rows with CCA cache stats and post-media recovery. |
| DSV4 Flash | Native composite cache is separate from generic TurboQuant KV; app-launch default-cache row cleared. | Long-output/code/file-generation quality and exactness remain open; media only if artifact advertises sidecars. | DSV4 long-output/code/file generation, restart-L2, exact-copy, tool loops, no generic TQ-KV substitution. |
| MiniMax M2.7 JANGTQ | K CRACK source-server smoke passed on 2026-06-06 with exact text, `paged+tq` cache hit, generic TurboQuant KV, L2 telemetry, multi-turn recall, reasoning, and required OpenAI tool call. Small JANGTQ rows also have prior proof. | Reporter/runtime mismatch and MiniMax K issue #179 parity/root cause remain open; installed-app parity still needed for the reporter class. | Installed app live rows for K/Small, reporter parity capture, parser/cache evidence, and any advertised media audit. |
| Hy3 / other JANGTQ | Not fully current-cleared in this slice. | Family-specific JANGTQ kernels, cache policy, media sidecars. | Live family smoke with advertised modalities and cache stats. |

## Known missing or incomplete runtime functions

This section is the implementation ledger. A row is not complete unless the
named function exists, routes through the live server path, and has source plus
installed-app proof where the product advertises the capability.

| Function area | Current implementation | Missing build work | Current blocker classification |
|---|---|---|---|
| Gemma4 dynamic image-prefill budget | `_resolve_vlm_image_prefill_single_buffer_limit()` scales the default with Metal working set, keeps explicit `VMLINUX_VLM_IMAGE_PREFILL_BUFFER_GB`, and typed 413 recovery exists. | Full installed-app media matrix: larger images, video, audio, tools after media, streaming/non-streaming parity. | `unknown_pending_repro` for remaining quality/media-depth rows, not the old fixed-8GB guard. |
| Gemma4 media post-error recovery | Panel removes a failed media user turn when no visible activity occurred, preventing replay of a rejected image on the next text turn. | Re-run through installed app for image reject, text-after-reject, video/audio-after-reject, and Responses/Chat parity. | `gateway_ui` until installed proof is current for every route. |
| Qwen VL/video processor bridge | Qwen video path has native processor wiring in source contracts: `videos=...`, `pixel_values_videos`, and `video_grid_thw` rows exist. | Current packaged Qwen27/35 MTP media matrix with MTP on/off, tools, streaming, and post-video text recovery. | `unknown_pending_repro` for broad media proof; stale `gdn_sink` crash is `gateway_ui` if only old app reproduces. |
| MiMo text runtime bridge | vMLX registers `mlx_vlm.models.mimo_v2` around `jang_tools.mimo_v2.mlx_model`; text/cache narrow proof exists. Missing media forward now raises typed `unsupported_media_modality` instead of a generic generation failure. | Real multimodal model module: vision encoder, audio encoder/tokenizer bridge, media projector/merger, `get_input_embeddings(pixel_values=...)`, `__call__(pixel_values=...)`, video/audio token expansion, and cache salt proof. | `runtime_dispatch` plus `model_artifact` pending source-vs-quant quality comparison. |
| MiMo JANG tools model forward | `/Users/eric/jang/jang-tools/jang_tools/mimo_v2/mlx_model.py` is explicitly text-only; its docstring says visual/audio towers are preserved but not wired. | Implement `mimo_v2_multimodal.py` or equivalent in JANG tools, then make vMLX register that module instead of a text-only compatibility shell. | `runtime_dispatch`; do not advertise VL/audio/video or force a parser/cache workaround. |
| MiMo long-prompt/tool quality | Cache classification and narrow text repeat work; conservative no-cache exact ACK can work. | First-divergence trace against source/higher-quality profile; tool protocol repair at model/template/runtime boundary; speed target proof. | `decode_loop` or `model_artifact` still unresolved. |
| Step3.7 VLM bridge | Source registration/no-heavy guards exist; text-only route is stable. | Real Step3.7 image/video processor, projector, forward, media cache salt, and live proof, or an explicit unsupported-VLM product row. | `runtime_dispatch`; text-only metadata view is not a VLM fix. |
| Nemotron Omni audio/video | Prior source rows exist for text/image/video/audio but are not current release-cleared. | Current source and installed app matrix for text-before/after media, audio/image/video carryover, tools, streaming, and L2. | `unknown_pending_repro`. |
| ZAYA/ZAYA1-VL media cache | Typed CCA cache contract exists; media routing rows exist in no-heavy contracts. | Live image/video rows proving media salt plus safe CCA/path-dependent restore and post-media recovery. | `kernel_cache` if partial restore fails; otherwise `unknown_pending_repro` until live. |
| MiniMax / Hy3 / Kimi media advertised variants | Text/tool/cache rows exist for selected bundles; media proof is not current in this slice. | Per-family advertised-modality audit: processor path, special tokens, cache policy, tools after media, installed-app parity. | `unknown_pending_repro`. |
| Shared structured-output repair | Register requires parse/repair/validate/retry while reporting raw parse failure. | Centralize benchmark/catalog repair for JSON/XML-ish outputs and prove raw-vs-repaired scoring rows. | `decode_loop` for native malformed output; caller-side repair is not guided decoding. |
| Release pointer/package parity | Source package pointers now track current 2026-06-06 artifacts and packaged integrity passes on the rebuilt staged app. | Full release still needs the seven live/model blockers closed, then notarized/stapled DMGs, install proof, public update manifest proof, and mlx.studio/vmlx.net download freshness proof. | `gateway_ui` until public release artifacts are current and verified. |

1. MiMo multimodal bridge

- `jang_tools.mimo_v2.mlx_model` is text-oriented; multimodal runtime is not release-proven.
- vMLX MiMo MLLM path must accept and correctly route image/video/audio tensors, not just load an MLLM wrapper.
- Tool parser must handle MiMo's template dialect without fabricating tool calls from malformed raw XML.
- Current fail-closed behavior is typed: unwired MiMo vision forward raises `UnsupportedMediaModalityError` / API code `unsupported_media_modality`. This is not a pass for MiMo vision; it is only correct failure classification and recovery.

2. Step3.7 VLM bridge

- Current safe route is text-only.
- Real Step3.7 VLM requires processor, media token expansion, model forward, cache salting, and full live proof.

3. Omni audio/video normalization

- Need current-source proof that audio/video content parts do not contaminate later text-only turns.
- Need installed app proof, not only source-server proof.

4. JSON/XML structured-output repair

- Bench/catalog tooling needs a shared parse/repair/validate/retry layer.
- vMLX should not claim hard constrained JSON/schema decoding unless a runtime option is implemented and live-proven.

5. Packaged parity

- Source fixes must be rebuilt, signed, notarized, stapled, installed, and tested from `/Applications/vMLX.app` before public release claims.
- Current-source proof alone does not update mlx.studio or vmlx.net downloads.

## Required test matrix per media-capable model

For each row below, capture full output tails and server logs:

1. Load and capability reflection

- `/health`, `/v1/models`, `/v1/models/{id}/capabilities`, `/v1/cache/stats`, panel settings, CLI preview.

2. Text baseline

- Chat completions, Responses, Anthropic messages, Ollama chat/generate where supported.
- Stream and non-stream.
- Thinking off/on if supported.

3. Image

- Small image.
- Large but valid image.
- Oversized or deliberately rejected image returns typed 413 and later text works.

4. Video

- Short local fixture.
- Multi-frame prompt.
- Text-after-video and video-after-text cache recovery.

5. Audio

- Short speech fixture.
- Non-speech/noise fixture.
- Audio-after-image and text-after-audio recovery.

6. Cache modes

- No prefix cache.
- Prefix cache.
- Paged cache.
- Block disk L2 cache.
- Family-native cache.
- TurboQuant KV only where architecture permits it.
- Native MTP on/off where artifact supports it.

7. Tools and structured output

- Forced single tool call.
- Tool result continuation.
- Multi-turn tool chain.
- JSON object, JSON schema/repair benchmark, XML/tool dialect rejection.

8. UI parity

- Create session, edit settings panel, max output tokens, max prompt tokens, cache toggles, modality upload controls.
- Run same proof through installed app gateway.

## Immediate next build order

1. Build MiMo media bridge in JANG tools first (`mimo_v2_multimodal.py` or equivalent), then update vMLX registration to use the real media model instead of the text-only compatibility shell.
2. Prove or falsify MiMo model-artifact quality from the actual Max2 bundle: source-vs-quant long-prompt trace, routed expert parity, tool-argument exactness, and speed target.
3. Add shared structured-output repair/validation to the video/catalog benchmark layer and report raw-vs-repaired score separately.
4. Re-run live media matrix for Gemma4 12B/26B, Qwen27/35 MTP, LFM, Step3.7 text-only, MiMo, Nemotron Omni, ZAYA-VL, DSV4, MiniMax, Hy3.
5. Close cross-family multi-turn and real Electron UI live model matrix rows.
6. Only after live rows pass: rebuild app, sign, notarize, staple, install, and repeat installed-app proofs before release/tag/public download update.

## 2026-06-06 cross-family media/cache refresh

Current proof artifacts now wired into the release gates:

- `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-live-slice-tools-media-continuation-20260606/summary.json` covers Gemma4 12B, LFM2.5, MiniMax Small, Qwen27, and Step3.7 text route.
- `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-ling-hy3-nemotron-tools-media-20260606/summary.json` covers Hy3, Ling/Bailing, and Nemotron Omni.
- `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-qwen35-mxfp8-mtp-tools-media-20260606/summary.json` covers Qwen35 MXFP8 MTP including the no-`gdn_sink` source path.
- `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-zaya-text-vl-tools-media-20260606/summary.json` is intentionally red and remains a required blocker.
- `build/current-dsv4-route-mode-code-exactness-memory-preflight-cross-family-20260606.json` keeps DSV4 live exactness closed to unsafe launch until enough RAM is available.

Current blockers to build, not guard away:

- MiMo V2.5 JANG_2L needs real multimodal runtime implementation in JANG tools/vMLX before VL/audio/video can be advertised. The current text compatibility shell and typed unsupported-media error are not a VL pass.
- MiMo text/tool quality still needs source-vs-quant first-divergence tracing, tool protocol repair at the real template/parser boundary, and speed proof. Do not force hidden prompts, fake tool-call conversion, or cache disablement as a production fix.
- ZAYA/ZAYA1-VL needs exact-instruction, reasoning-visible-output, multi-turn recall, and red-image semantic fixes while preserving the CCA/path-dependent cache constraints.
- DSV4 needs a safe-memory live host for long-output/code/file-generation and restart/L2 exactness proof.
- Real Electron UI still needs the same family matrix from installed app settings through spawned server args, `/health`, cache stats, media upload, max output tokens, streaming/non-streaming, and post-error recovery.

Release sequencing remains:

1. Close MiMo, ZAYA, DSV4, MiniMax reporter parity, and real Electron UI live rows with full-output artifacts.
2. Rebuild bundled Python/app from that source.
3. Sign, notarize, staple, install, and rerun installed-app proofs.
4. Publish release/tag/downloads only after public vmlx.net and mlx.studio download freshness is proven current.
