# vMLX Python Engine Release Handoff - 2026-06-11

## Current Commit

- Latest pushed commit before this correction: `9e33201bd Document release blocker handoff`
- Pushed to: `origin/codex/pr-intake-manifest` and `origin/main`
- Latest checklist artifact:
  `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-qwen35-gate-correction-20260611.json`
- Latest checklist state: `status=open`, `failed_count=15`

## Hard Boundaries

- Do not work from deprecated `/Users/eric/vmlx`.
- Do not spawn/manage subagents from Python, shell, MCP, or wrappers.
- Do not touch Nex/N2 `JANG_1L` unless Eric explicitly reopens it in the
  current turn.
- Do not sign, notarize, tag, upload, PyPI-release, update downloads, or touch
  site/updater release paths unless Eric explicitly unlocks release actions in
  the current turn.
- Do not fake parser/cache/media fixes: no synthetic tool args, no disabling
  reasoning to hide failures, no metadata-only audio/video claims, no parser
  repair of model-generated literal mutations.

## Proven In Latest Movement

- Nemotron Omni current all-local JANGTQ proof is consumed by the release
  checklist:
  `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-ling-hy3-nemotron-tools-media-20260606/dealign.ai_Nemotron-Omni-Nano-JANGTQ-CRACK/result.json`
- Nemotron proof covers: text cache repeat, reasoning-on visible output,
  required `record_fact` tool call with `{"value":"blue-cat"}`, tool-result
  continuation, JSON/code/whitespace exactness, blue image, blue video, blue
  audio, post-media text recovery, native hybrid SSM cache, paged+SSM reuse,
  block L2 writes/hits, and SSM L2 writes.
- Qwen35 direct/gateway source proof remains good, but direct/gateway/tunnel
  parity is not release-green because the fresh public tunnel recapture is
  still stale:
  `build/current-responses-raw-sse-parity-qwen35-direct-gateway-tunnel-public-recapture-still-stale-20260611.json`
- Qwen35 public tunnel still preserves model, authoritative
  `{"value":"blue-cat"}` arguments, function-call argument deltas/done, final
  response consistency, and valid message/function output indices, but it lacks
  complete streamed reasoning output item lifecycle. Keep this row red until
  the tunnel runtime is rebuilt and recaptured.

## Still Open

- `prepackage_ready` and `release_ready`: intentionally false while blocker
  rows remain open.
- `n2_pro_397b_release_clearance`: dominated by N2 `JANG_1L`, which is
  Eric-owned/off-limits for this lane. Do not claim or launch it here.
- MiMo: exactness/media/speed remain open. Current classification says
  JANGTQ_2 literal mutations happen after valid parser structure; do not clear
  by rewriting parsed tool arguments or repairing generated JSON.
- Qwen35 raw SSE direct/gateway/tunnel parity remains open on public tunnel
  reasoning lifecycle, even though current direct/gateway source proof is
  green.
- MiniMax issue179: current source and local installed probes are clean, but
  reporter parity is not proven. The current audit is intentionally open
  because reporter artifact/session evidence is missing and reporter installed
  server hash differs from the latest public/local server hash.
- DSV4: memory/exactness preflight is skipped/open due insufficient available
  memory for that gate.

## Other-Agent Next Best Work

- If deploy/tunnel access exists, refresh exact-served-model raw SSE parity
  artifacts only when the served route really advertises and serves the target
  model; do not pointer-refresh to a stale or partial capture.
- For MiniMax issue179, collect reporter parity metadata/artifacts: reporter
  model shard/codebook hashes, installed app server hash, chat/session/settings
  DB state, response active-state at cancel time, raw SSE/cancel lifecycle, and
  original prompt/log ordering. Without that evidence, keep #179 open.
- For MiMo, focus on artifact/logit/quant contract or runtime decode diagnosis.
  Current parser/cache/L2 evidence does not support a parser or cache-only fix.
- For release packaging, first rerun the bundled Python parity gate and
  installed-app source-vs-bundle checks after source rows are worth packaging;
  then follow the documented signing/notarization workflow only after Eric
  unlocks release actions.
